Welcome to my blog! 😁

I’m **Tong Phan Kim Thach**, an aspiring **Software Engineer** with a strong focus on **Java Backend Development**. I'm currently studying **Data Science** at the **University of Industry, Ho Chi Minh City**, but my passion lies in building scalable and maintainable backend systems.

This blog is where I share what I’ve learned — from Java core concepts, RESTful API development, database integration, to backend architecture patterns and real-world debugging experiences. I believe writing is a powerful tool for reflection and growth, and I hope these posts will be helpful for others on the same journey.

The blog is written in English to help me improve my communication skills. If you notice any mistakes, especially in technical terms, I’d appreciate your feedback!
